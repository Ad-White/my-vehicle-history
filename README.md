# My Vehicle History

The purpose of this website is to provide users with somewhere to keep a log of their vehicles. Whether currently and/or previously owned.
With this application I hope to provide a solution to the real world case, I have experienced myself over the years. With regards to people I have met or know, who are enthusiastic about their own vehicles.
Typically during a discussion about vehicles we have owned, I find it would be nice to actually see a photograph of the vehicle in question. Only to remember it's tucked away in a drawer or on an old phone or a hard-drive, somewhere!
With the above in mind, I have decided to call this website, My Vehicle History.

## User Experience (UX)

My intended and expected audience will consist of friends and people I know, that have a passion for their vehicles. Also, generally anyone that would like to use the sites services to keep a log of their vehicles, or just for the pleasure of viewing a selection of other member's cars, motorcycles, etc.
My intention has been to design a website that is visually pleasing, easy to use, and one which I hope my audience will enjoy using. And will return to again in time, to add more content to their vehicle history.
